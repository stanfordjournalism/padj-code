# Python Projects

Generally we use VS Code as our code editor and the `uv` command-line tool to manage both Python installation and depencencies (e.g. installing pandas, altair, etc.).

See [these instructions](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/integration/jupyter/#using-jupyter-from-vs-code) for details on how to use Jupyter notebooks from VS Code in combination with `uv`-managed virtual environments and dependencies.
