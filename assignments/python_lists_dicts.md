> **NOTE: You don't have to do the exercises in Automate the Boring Stuff, but you should type in the commands for code examples throughout the text. Use a [JupyterLite notebook tab][] or fire up an interactive Python shell in GitHub Codespace by typing `python` in the Bash terminal.**

* Lists
	* Read [Automate's Chapter 4 on Lists](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter4/) and **stop right before** the section titled [Example Program: Magic 8 Ball with a List](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter4/#calibre_link-2296).

* Dictionaries (key/value mappings)
	* Read the top two sections in [Automate's Chapter 5 on Dictionaries ](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/chapter5/): *The Dictionary Data Type* and *Dictionaries vs. Lists*
	*  [W3C schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_dictionaries.asp) - Review all sections on dictionary syntax and work through the [exercises](https://www.w3schools.com/python/exercise.asp?filename=exercise_dictionaries1) at the end.
