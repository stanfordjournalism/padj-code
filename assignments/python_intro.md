# Goal

Learn and practice some Python fundamentals. We're assuming some comfort with these basics next class, so don't skimp on the Python learning!

## Python reading and practice

Work through the [Python Syntax Crash Course][] if you were absent or if we didn't complete it during class.

Read and work through Chapters 0-2 in [Automate the Boring Stuff][] (2nd Edition), along with the other resources specified below.

> **NOTE: You don't have to do the exercises in Automate the Boring Stuff, but you should type in the commands for code examples throughout the text.**

> **Ignore the book's instructions on where to write code.** Instead, you should use our [Data Journalism Notebooks](https://stanfordjournalism.github.io/data-journalism-notebooks/lab/) site and just create a new notebook to experiment in. Some additional options that we'll cover in class include: (1) the standard [`python` interactive shell](/docs/tech_faq.md#how-do-i-open-a-python-interactive-session-on-the-command-line) on the [command-line](/docs/tech_faq.md#how-do-i-use-a-command-line-shell-aka-terminal); (2) a text editor such as VS Code, which provides a built-in command line shell for running Python scripts (aka files containing Python code with `.py` extension); (3) a GitHub Codespace, which provides a full development environment in the cloud that lets you code in Python and run the files.

* [Chapter 0 - Introduction](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/chapter0/) - Read from top through *Programming is a Creative Activity*
* [Chapter 1 - Python Basics](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/chapter1/) - Work through the whole chapter. For *Your First Program*, use VS Code or another code editor to create `hello.py`. Then run it on the command line by executing `python hello.py`.
* [Chapter 2 - Flow Control](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/chapter2/) - Read through *Flow Control Statements - Elif Statements* (stop just before [while Loop Statements](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/chapter2/#calibre_link-121))
* ["for" loops (W3C)](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_for_loops.asp) - Read and work through all sections

## Code

Work through the **Code Challenge** at the end of the [Python Syntax Crash Course][].
