    "# Accessing Census data with Python\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook walks you through the process of getting data using Datamade's [census library for Python](https://github.com/datamade/census). At the same time we will introduce you to the concept of uncertainty in sample data and how to work with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting started\n",
    "To get started:\n",
    "1. In the terminal, run `pipenv install` in the same directory as this noteboook to install the required libraries.\n",
    "2. You will need a Census API key. You can get one [here](https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html).\n",
    "3. Create a Python file in the same directory called **census_api_key.py**. In that file define a variable called `KEY`and assign your Census API key as the value: `KEY = '<your api key here>'`.\n",
    "4. Start the pipenv environment by running `pipenv shell` in the terminal.\n",
    "5. Once the shell is launched, run `jupyter lab` in the terminal to start Jupyter Lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Importing the tools we need to work with data\n",
    "First we import the libraries we are going to use to get data and analyze it. We are using three main libraries:\n",
    "- **[Pandas:](https://pandas.pydata.org/)** The toolkit we use to conduct data analysis\n",
    "- **[Census:](https://github.com/datamade/census)** This library makes it easier to access Census data through the API.\n",
    "- **[Altair:](https://altair-viz.github.io/)** This library is used to create data visualizations using data in Pandas.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also need to import the API key so we can use the Census API."
