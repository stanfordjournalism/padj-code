# Census Overview and Coding Exercises

An overview of Census data and how to use the Census API to grab particular data points, margins of error, and fold them into your `pandas` and Jupyter workflow.

- [Overview](overview.md) - high-level intro to Census data and various tools and platforms for working with it.
- [01-census-basics.ipynb](01-census-basics.ipynb) - Basics of how to use the Census API to get ACS data, including considerations related to margins of error.
- [02-states-counties.ipynb](01-census-basics.ipynb) - How to grab data for multiple states and/or counties.

## Setup

```bash
git clone git@github.com:stanfordjournalism/padj-code.git
cd padj-code/exercises/census
uv venv
uv pip install -r pyproject.toml
uv pip install census ipykernel
```

> In addition to `pandas` and `altair`, the above should install the [`census` Python client library][], which is designed to simplify accessing data from the American Community Survey.

Open the `census-python.ipynb` file in Visual Studio Code. Then use `Select kernel` in the upper right to choose the virtual environment generated by the `uv venv` command.

> NOTE: If you don't see the correct environment available, restart VS Code and try again.

## Census API Key

Get a [Census API key](https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html).

After obtaining a key, create a file called `census_api_key.py` in the `padj-code/exercises/census/` folder.

Inside the file, add the following, making sure to substitute your actual API key for `YOUR_KEY`:

```python
KEY="YOUR_KEY"
```
